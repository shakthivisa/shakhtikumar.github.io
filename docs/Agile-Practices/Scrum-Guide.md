set of Practices that take Programming to the Extreme, i.e. just enough, just-in-time with minimalist approach; relies heavily on people


### Feature Driven Development (FDD) 
The major functionlity is the core of the this FDD.A major fucntionlity that gives most business value is indentified by the 
business stake holders and that forms the feature.
A group of features are created and they are taken up in priority.

### Test Driven Development
This is a eolutionary approch where in the developers write theb test first and then the code.
â€“ an XP technique turns traditional Code Development upside-down, i.e. write test first and then write (just enough) code to fulfil 
that test and move-on to write the next test, then code, etc.; relies on availability of automated test tools
