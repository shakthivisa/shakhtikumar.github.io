# SoftwareCraftmanship Manifesto

> Software craftsmanship is an approach to software development that emphasizes the coding skills of the software developers. 
	It is a response by software developers to the perceived ills of the mainstream software industry, 
including the prioritization of financial concerns over developer accountability.

As aspiring Software Craftsmen we are raising the bar of professional software development by practicing it and helping others learn the craft. Through this work we have come to value:

Not only working software, but also well-crafted software   
Not only responding to change, but also steadily adding value  
Not only individuals and interactions, but also a community of professionals  
Not only customer collaboration, but also productive partnerships  
That is, in pursuit of the items on the left we have found the items on the right to be indispensable.
